# Basic Git Scraper Template

I wanted to scrape headlines from the Health section, so I changed the requested url accordingly. I inspected the headlines there and found that they didn't have <a>...class="frontpage-link"...</a> like the main headline, but they did have class="standard-link" with h3's instead of a's. I thus changed the code to work around that, which was sufficient for what I wanted to do.
