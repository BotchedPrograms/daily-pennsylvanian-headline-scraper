# Basic Git Scraper Template

I wanted to scrape headlines from the Health section, so I changed the requested url accordingly. I inspected the headlines there and found that they didn't have (a)...class="frontpage-link"...(a) like the main headline, but they did have (h3)...class="standard-link"...(h3) [sic]. I thus changed the code to work around that, which was sufficient for what I wanted to do.
